# AI-Powered Recipe and Meal Planning App

## Overview

This is an AI-powered recipe and meal planning application built with the T3 Stack. Our goal is to revolutionize the way you discover and plan your meals by providing personalized recipe suggestions and comprehensive meal plans tailored to your unique nutritional requirements and dietary preferences.

## Features

*   **Intelligent Recipe Generation:** Leveraging AI, the app can generate a wide array of recipes based on specific ingredients, cuisines, dietary restrictions (e.g., vegan, gluten-free), and nutritional goals (e.g., high protein, low carb).
*   **Personalized Meal Plans:** Create multi-day meal plans that automatically account for your nutritional needs, ensuring a balanced and varied diet.
*   **Nutritional Tracking:** Get detailed nutritional information for each recipe and meal plan, including calories, macros (protein, carbs, fats), and micronutrients.
*   **Dietary Preferences & Allergies:** Easily input your dietary preferences, allergies, and restrictions to ensure all generated content is safe and suitable for you.
*   **User Profiles:** Save your preferences, favorite recipes, and past meal plans for easy access and re-use.
*   **Ingredient Management:** Keep track of ingredients you have on hand to generate recipes that utilize them, minimizing food waste.
*   **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface for seamless navigation and interaction.

## Technologies Used

This project is built on the robust and efficient T3 Stack:

*   **Next.js:** A React framework for production-grade applications, offering features like server-side rendering and static site generation.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer experience.
*   **tRPC:** A powerful tool for building end-to-end type-safe APIs, ensuring type safety from the backend to the frontend.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs without leaving your HTML.
*   **Prisma:** A next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript, simplifying database interactions.
*   **Better Auth:** A modern authentication solution for Next.js applications, offering flexibility and ease of integration.

### AI Integration

*   **[Specify AI Model/Platform]:** (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3.5/GPT-4, Google's Gemini, Hugging Face models) for natural language understanding and recipe generation.
*   **[Specify any other AI libraries/frameworks]:** (e.g., LangChain for orchestration, specific NLP libraries)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or Yarn
*   Git
*   A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) â€“ local or cloud-based
*   An API key for your chosen AI model (e.g., OpenAI API Key)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-recipe-app.git
    cd ai-recipe-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project based on `.env.example` and fill in the required values:

    ```env
    # Database
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/ai-recipe-app"

    # Better Auth (Example variables - actual names depend on Better Auth config)
    AUTH_SECRET="your_auth_secret_key"
    AUTH_CALLBACK_URL="http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback" # Or your deployment URL

    # Google Provider (Optional, for authentication)
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_client_secret"

    # AI API Key
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key" # Or for your chosen AI model
    ```
    *   `DATABASE_URL`: Your database connection string.
    *   `AUTH_SECRET`: A long, random string used for Better Auth's internal operations.
    *   `AUTH_CALLBACK_URL`: The callback URL for your authentication provider.
    *   `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your API key for the AI model used.

4.  **Database Migration:**
    Run Prisma migrations to set up your database schema:
    ```bash
    npx prisma db push
    ```

5.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
